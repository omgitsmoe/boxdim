## Overview

treeseg has been developed to near-automatically extract tree-level point clouds from high-density larger-area lidar point clouds acquired in forested scenes.
A full description of the methods can be found here: http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1575534/ (pp. 96-167)

Briefly, libtreeseg provides a set of generic functions that have been wrapped here into a series of executables to: i) identify individual stems in the larger-area point cloud (findstems), ii) extract each of these identified stems up to the first order of branching (segmentstem), and iii) segment each individual crown from neighbouring vegetation (segmentcrown).

Integrated into treeseg is libleafsep, a library providing methods to separate wood and leaf returns in unorganised point clouds. 
libleafsep is a modified translation of TLSeparation (https://github.com/TLSeparation).

## Prerequisites

treeseg has been developed using:

* Point Cloud Library (PCL) (http://pointclouds.org) (v1.7 or later)
* Armadillo (http://arma.sourceforge.net) (v7.960 or later)

On RHEL 7, these dependencies can be installed via:

```
yum install cmake
yum install pcl pcl-devel pcl-tools pcl-doc
yum install armadillo armadillo-devel
```

On Ubuntu:

```
apt-get install -y git cmake
apt-get install -y libpcl-dev
apt-get install -y libproj-dev
```

On macOS 10.13, dependencies are perhaps most easily installed via Homebrew (https://brew.sh):

```
brew install cmake
brew install pcl
brew install armadillo
```

## Installation

Install libtreeseg and the associated binaries as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/apburt/treeseg.git;
cd treeseg;
mkdir build;
cd build;
cmake ../src;
make;
```

Also included in treeseg is rxp2pcd, for conversion of REIGL V-Line scan data to .pcd binary format. Linux-only, this requires the RiVLIB headers and libraries (downloadable from: http://www.riegl.com/index.php?id=224) to be installed in /treeseg/include/riegl/ and /treeseg/lib/ respectively.

## Usage

Below is an example usage of the treeseg binaries:

* plotcoords ../matrix/ > nouragesH20_coords.dat
* rxp2pcd ../ nouraguesH20_coords.dat 60 15 nouraguesH20
* nearestneighbour 1 4 nouraguesH20.sample.pcd > nouraguesH20_nn.dat
* downsample 0.04 1 nouraguesH20_*.pcd
* getdemslice 2 3 6 nouraguesH20_*.downsample.pcd
* findstems 15 0.2 2 ../nouraguesH20_coords.dat ../nouraguesH20.slice.downsample.pcd
* segmentstem 12.5 ../nouraguesH20.downsample.pcd ../clusters/cluster_*.pcd
* getcrownvolume ../nouraguesH20.downsample.pcd ../stems/stem_*.pcd
* segmentcrown [14 - 16] ../volume_*.pcd
